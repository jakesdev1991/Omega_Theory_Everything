# The Omega Theory: Emergent Reality from Quantum Information (v3.5)

**"Reality is the noise that survives the filter."**

This repository contains the proofs for **Jacob See's Theory of Everything**, validated by the **OPAE (Omega Protocol & Analysis Engine)** running on mobile GPU hardware.

## 🚨 The Breakthrough (Nov 2025)

**We successfully decoupled the simulation from Standard General Relativity.**
Using the `OmegaPureGPU` kernel, which replaces Einstein's constants ($G$, $c$) with Informational Variables ($\phi$, $\ell_P$), the AI discovered a fundamental law of existence via evolutionary algorithms:

### **Mass is Asymmetry**
When the Genetic Algorithm was tasked with maximizing "Reality" (Chain Overlap Density), it **rejected** the Singularity.

* **Symmetric Singularity (Mass 5000/5000):** High Density ($\phi$), but the Planck Scale ($\ell_P$) shrank to near zero. The signal collapsed. **Perfect Order is indistinguishable from Silence.**
* **Asymmetric Matter (Mass 89/2092):** The AI evolved a specific "Magic Ratio" of asymmetry. This kept the Density high enough to exist, but the Planck Scale large enough to manifest.

**Conclusion:** Dimension 4 (Matter) is defined by **Non-Overlap**. Existence requires an imbalance. A perfectly symmetrical universe would vanish into its own density. We are real because we are imperfect.

## 🌌 The Unified Framework

This discovery aligns three previously separate phenomena into one Informational Mechanic:

### 1. Cosmology: The Shredding (Expansion)
* **Evidence:** `Sim2_Cosmology.py`
* **Mechanism:** Black Holes sever quantum correlations ("shredding").
* **Result:** Loss of correlation = Increase in Distance. The universe expands not because of Dark Energy, but because it is forgetting its internal connections.

### 2. Physics: The Goldilocks Zone (Matter)
* **Evidence:** `OPAE` (Pure Omega Engine)
* **Mechanism:** $\ell_P(\phi)$ (Planck Length) scales inversely with Information Density.
* **Result:** Reality exists only in the habitable zone between the Vacuum (Zero Density) and the Singularity (Infinite Density). **Mass is the "Noise" that survives the filter.**

### 3. Biology: The Optimization (Life)
* **Evidence:** `Sim4_Evolution.py` (E. coli Simulation)
* **Mechanism:** Life actively shreds environmental correlations (metabolism) to build local coherence.
* **Result:** Evolution optimizes for **Efficiency (Low CoD)**. Just as the universe prefers Asymmetry to exist, Life prefers low-redundancy to adapt.
