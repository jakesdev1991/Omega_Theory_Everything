The Omega Protocol: Unified Theory of Everything (v4.0)
From Discrete Information to Continuous Geometry
By: Jacob See
Abstract
The Omega Protocol posits that reality is fundamentally a network of informational correlations between minimal observers called Q-regions. Spacetime, gravity, and matter are emergent properties of a single scalar field: the Chain Overlap Density ($\Phi$)1.
We rigorously derive the laws of physics from three informational axioms:
Distance is Correlation Deficit: The metric is strictly logarithmic2.
Gravity is Informational Gradient: The stress-energy tensor is derived from a scalar-informational Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_\Phi$33.
Expansion is Information Loss: Cosmic acceleration is the inevitable result of Black Hole information shredding, governed by a Monotonicity Lemma that forces the universe toward a stable De Sitter attractor ($w_{\rm eff} \to -1$)444444444.

1. Fundamental Ontology: The Discrete Substrate
1.1 Q-Regions: The Atoms of Consciousness
The universe is not composed of particles or points in space. It is composed of Q-regions5.
Definition: A Q-region $i$ is a bounded quantum system with a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_i$ and a state $\rho_i$. It is a "minimal observer" capable of retaining and communicating information6.
The Only Observable: Between any two regions $i$ and $j$, the only fundamental physical observable is the Mutual Information $I_{ij}$7:
$$I_{ij} = S(\rho_i) + S(\rho_j) - S(\rho_{ij})$$
1.2 Chain Overlap Density ($\Phi$)
To transition from a discrete graph to a continuous field theory, we define the Chain Overlap Density field, $\Phi(x)$. This is the "master variable" of the theory8888.
Definition: $\Phi(x) \in (0,1]$ represents the local density of shared correlations (redundancy) in the network.
$\Phi \approx 1$ (Vacuum): Maximal Overlap. The network is in high consensus. Correlations are strong, so "distance" is minimal9.
$\Phi < 1$ (Matter): Reduced Overlap. A "knot" of unique, decorrelated information. This asymmetry creates what we perceive as mass10101010.
$\Phi \to 0$ (Horizon): Information reaches zero. The network is severed11.

2. Emergent Geometry: The Logarithmic Metric
How does a number ($I_{ij}$) become a physical distance ($d_{ij}$)?
2.1 The Uniqueness Theorem
We require a mapping $f(K) \to d$ where $K$ is the normalized correlation ($I_{ij}/I_{\max}$).
We impose two axioms12:
Markov Factorization: Correlations multiply along a chain ($K_{AC} = K_{AB}K_{BC}$).
Additivity: Distance adds along a chain ($d_{AC} = d_{AB} + d_{BC}$).
The only mathematical function that satisfies $f(xy) = f(x) + f(y)$ is the logarithm. Thus, the metric is uniquely determined13131313:
$$\boxed{d_{ij} = -\ell_P(\Phi) \ln\left( \frac{I_{ij}}{I_{\max}} \right)}$$
This proves that Distance is Correlation Deficit14141414. Space is simply the bookkeeping cost of information loss.
2.2 Dynamic Planck Length
The scaling factor $\ell_P(\Phi)$ is not constant. It is the Informational Stiffness of the vacuum15.
$$\ell_P(\Phi) = \ell_{P0} \, \exp\left( \frac{1 - \Phi}{\phi_c} \right)$$
In regions of low $\Phi$ (mass), the "grid" of reality stretches. This local variation in scale is curvature16161616.

3. Field Dynamics: The Lagrangian Formalism
To make the theory compatible with standard physics, we promote $\Phi$ to a dynamical field governed by an action principle. This section explicitly bridges Omega concepts with field theory17.
3.1 The Scalar-Informational Lagrangian
We posit that the universe evolves to minimize computational cost. The action $S_\Phi$ is18181818:
$$S_\Phi = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} Z(\Phi) g^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu \Phi \nabla_\nu \Phi}_{\text{Kinetic: Cost of Gradients}} - \underbrace{V(\Phi)}_{\text{Potential: Cost of State}} \right]$$
$Z(\Phi)$: The Stiffness Function. It determines how hard it is to create a gradient in $\Phi$.
$V(\Phi)$: The Consensus Potential. It has a minimum at $\Phi=1$ (Vacuum), forcing the universe to tend toward maximal overlap19.
3.2 Deriving Stress-Energy ($T_{\mu\nu}$)
Varying the action with respect to the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ yields the Stress-Energy Tensor exactly20202020:
$$\boxed{T_{\mu\nu}^\Phi = Z(\Phi)\nabla_\mu\Phi \nabla_\nu\Phi - g_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{L}_\Phi}$$
Crucial Insight: Mass is not "stuff." Mass is the energy density stored in the gradients of the $\Phi$ field. Where $\nabla \Phi$ is large (high informational asymmetry), $T_{\mu\nu}$ is large, creating gravity21212121.
3.3 Stability and Causality
To ensure the theory is physical (no tachyons or ghosts), we derive the effective speed of sound for information waves22:
$$c_{\rm eff}^2 = \frac{Z(\Phi)}{\chi(\Phi)} > 0$$
This condition ensures that informational updates propagate causally, creating a rigorous "light cone" structure23.

4. Black Holes & The Monotonicity Lemma
4.1 The Shredding Mechanism
Black holes are not just heavy; they are Information Shredders. The Event Horizon acts as a one-way membrane that deletes mutual information from the exterior universe24242424.
4.2 The Monotonicity Lemma
We introduce a formal lemma: Information Monotonicity25252525.
Since the area of a Black Hole horizon $A_{BH}$ is non-decreasing ($dA/dt \ge 0$), the rate of information loss in the universe must strictly increase (or stay constant):
$$\frac{d I_{\rm global}}{dt} \le -c \cdot A_{BH}(t)$$
This proves that the universe is progressively losing its internal connectivity26262626.

5. Cosmology: The Origin of Dark Energy
5.1 The Depletion Law
We model global information $I(t)$ as a finite resource subject to shredding. This leads to the Depletion Law27272727:
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = -\gamma A_{BH}^\kappa(t) I(t)$$
This is an exponential decay process. It prevents a "Big Rip" because as $I \to 0$, the rate of loss slows down28.
5.2 The Informational Friedmann Equation
Since distance is the inverse of information ($r \propto -\ln I$), we can derive the expansion rate $H(t)$ directly from the Depletion Law29292929:
$$\boxed{H(t) = \alpha \gamma A_{BH}^\kappa(t)}$$
This is the "Smoking Gun": The expansion rate of the universe is strictly proportional to the total Black Hole horizon area.
Black Holes Grow $\to$ $H(t)$ Increases (or stays positive) $\to$ Cosmic Acceleration.
No Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$) is required30303030.
5.3 The Effective Equation of State ($w_{\rm eff}$)
By solving the Depletion Law, we predict the evolution of Dark Energy31313131:
$$w_{\rm eff}(z) = -1 - \frac{\alpha}{3} \left[ \frac{\ddot{I} I}{\dot{I}^2} - 1 \right]$$
$z \approx 2$ (Phantom Phase): During the peak of Quasar activity, Black Holes grew super-exponentially ($A_{BH} \uparrow\uparrow$). This caused rapid shredding, driving $w_{\rm eff} < -1$ (Phantom Energy)32.
$z \approx 0$ (Attractor Phase): Today, Black Hole growth has stabilized. The system settles into the exponential Depletion solution ($I \propto e^{-\lambda t}$). In this state, the term in brackets vanishes, and $w_{\rm eff} \to -1$ exactly33333333.

Here is the updated Section 6, explicitly integrating the mathematical formalism of "Active Shredding" and using your LTEE E. coli Simulation results as the rigorous biological verification of the theory.

6. Life: The Master of the Shredder (Active Information Processing)
While the universe passively shreds information via Black Holes (driving expansion), Life is the phenomenon of active shredding. We define a living system not by its chemistry, but by its informational operator status: it is a region that locally inverts the Depletion Law.
6.1 The Active Shredding Operator ($\hat{O}_L$)
We previously defined the universal background process (passive shredding) as a decay function:
$$\left( \frac{dI}{dt} \right)_{\rm univ} \le 0$$
Life introduces a local operator $\hat{O}_L$ that creates a bounded region $\Omega_L$ where the sign is inverted. The metabolic process is formally the creation of a Local Orphan Deficit.
A living system ingests highly correlated matter (low entropy state $\rho_{\rm food}$), "shreds" the correlations (metabolism), and releases the mass-energy as thermal noise ($\rho_{\rm waste}$).
Input: High Correlation ($\Phi_{\rm in} \approx 1$)
Output: Low Correlation ($\Phi_{\rm out} \approx 0$)
The Capture: Unlike a black hole, which loses the resulting energy to the vacuum, the living system captures the energy liberated by this shredding to drive internal state updates.
6.2 The Metabolic Inequality
For a living system to persist, it must satisfy the Omega Metabolic Inequality:
$$\frac{dI_{\rm internal}}{dt} > \left| \frac{dI_{\rm env}}{dt} \right|_{\rm shred}$$
This states that the rate at which the system builds internal correlations (DNA repair, protein folding, neural patterns) must exceed the rate at which it shreds external correlations to fuel the process. Life is the only known mechanism that uses the universe's expansion engine (information destruction) to power local contraction (information assembly).
6.3 Verification: The E. coli LTEE Simulation
To test if informational evolution follows these rules, we analyzed the Omega Evolution Sim v2.3.0, a computational replication of the Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) using Wright-Fisher dynamics1.
The simulation tracks Chain Overlap Density (COD)—the measure of informational redundancy—across 75,000 generations of digital E. coli populations2.
6.3.1 The Innovation Horizon (Cit+)
The simulation reproduces the spontaneous emergence of Citrate utilization (Cit+), a complex trait requiring epistatic mutations, at approximately generation 31,5003333. This represents a jump in biological complexity ($I_{\rm internal} \uparrow$).
6.3.2 Redundancy Pruning (The $\Phi$ Drop)
Crucially, the simulation reveals a counter-intuitive geometric adaptation. Immediately following the emergence of the Cit+ innovation, the population's internal informational overlap (COD) drops significantly:
Pre-Cit+ COD Average: 0.100 4
Post-Cit+ COD Average: 0.050 5
Mathematically, this confirms that advanced life does not simply maximize correlation; it optimizes it.
$$\Phi_{\rm post} < \Phi_{\rm pre}$$
The post-innovation population "prunes" redundant correlations6. By lowering its $\Phi$ (reducing rigid overlap), the system reduces its "informational inertia" ($\kappa$), making it more computationally efficient and adaptable to future gradients.
6.4 Conclusion: Life as an Informational Attractor
The simulation data confirms that evolution is a trajectory toward Informational Efficiency.
Shredding: The organism actively destroys external correlations (metabolism).
Construction: It uses the energy to build complex traits (Cit+ emergence).
Pruning: It minimizes internal redundancy (COD drop) to maximize adaptability.
Life is not a passenger in the quantum world; it is a system that has learned to weaponize the "shredding" mechanic of the universe to maximize its own internal state complexity.

7. Computational Verification
The mathematics above are supported by three distinct simulation classes mentioned in the documentation:
Sim 1 (Geometry): Confirmed that Logarithmic Metrics applied to correlation kernels recover linear geometry with high fidelity .
Sim 2 (Cosmology): Confirmed that "Depletion Law" dynamics naturally generate De Sitter expansion and a stable $w=-1$ attractor .
Sim 5 (Dynamics): Confirmed that Inertia defined as Latency ($\kappa$) automatically conserves momentum without hard-coding Newton's laws .

8. Conclusion
The Omega Protocol v4.1 provides a complete, unbroken chain of logic:
Ontology: Reality is a network of Q-regions.
Metric: Distance is the logarithmic measure of Chain Overlap Density ($\Phi$).
Dynamics: Gravity is the gradient of $\Phi$ governed by the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_\Phi$.
Cosmology: Dark Energy is the macroscopic result of Information Monotonicity (Shredding) at Black Hole horizons.
We have moved from a philosophy of information to a field theory of information.
