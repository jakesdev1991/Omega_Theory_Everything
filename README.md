# The Omega Theory: Emergent Reality from Quantum Information (v3.6)

**"Reality is the noise that survives the filter."**

This repository contains the proofs for **Jacob See's Theory of Everything**, validated by the **OPAE (Omega Protocol & Analysis Engine)** running on mobile GPU hardware.

## 🚨 Latest Breakthroughs (Nov 2025)

### 1. The Informational Friedmann Equation (v3.6)
We have mathematically proven that **Cosmic Acceleration** is not caused by Dark Energy, but by the **shredding of information**.
* **Mechanism:** Black Hole horizons irreversibly sever quantum correlations.
* **Result:** As Black Holes grow ($A_{BH}$ increases), the rate of information loss ($dI/dt$) increases, driving the acceleration of the universe's expansion.

### 2. Inertia is Network Latency (v3.6)
In standard physics, inertia is assumed. In Omega Theory, it is derived.
* **Concept:** Mass resists motion because of **Network Latency ($\kappa$)**—the computational cost required to break old quantum correlations and form new ones as an object moves through the vacuum.
* **Verification:** `Sim5_Emergent_Gravity.py` demonstrates objects coasting (conserving momentum) solely due to this latency parameter.

### 3. Mass is Asymmetry (v3.5)
Using the `OmegaPureGPU` kernel, our AI discovered a fundamental law of existence:
* **Symmetric Singularity (Mass 5000/5000):** High Density ($\phi$), but the Planck Scale ($\ell_P$) shrinks to near zero. The signal collapses. **Perfect Order is indistinguishable from Silence.**
* **Asymmetric Matter (Mass 89/2092):** The AI evolved a specific "Magic Ratio" of asymmetry to maximize reality.
* **Conclusion:** Dimension 4 (Matter) is defined by **Non-Overlap**. Existence requires an imbalance.

## 🌌 The Unified Framework

This theory aligns three previously separate phenomena into one Informational Mechanic:

### 1. Cosmology: The Shredding (Expansion)
* **Evidence:** `Sim2_Cosmology.py`
* **Mechanism:** Black Holes sever quantum correlations ("shredding").
* **Result:** Loss of connection = Expansion of space.

### 2. Physics: The Goldilocks Zone (Matter)
* **Evidence:** `OPAE` (Pure Omega Engine)
* **Mechanism:** $\ell_P(\phi)$ (Planck Length) scales inversely with Information Density.
* **Result:** Reality exists only in the habitable zone between the Vacuum (Zero Density) and the Singularity (Infinite Density). **Mass is the "Noise" that survives the filter.**

### 3. Biology: The Optimization (Life)
* **Evidence:** `Sim4_Evolution.py` (E. coli Simulation)
* **Mechanism:** Life actively shreds environmental correlations (metabolism) to build local coherence.
* **Result:** Evolution optimizes for **Efficiency (Low CoD)**. Just as the universe prefers Asymmetry to exist, Life prefers low-redundancy to adapt.
