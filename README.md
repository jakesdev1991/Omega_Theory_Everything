The Omega Protocol: Unified Theory of Everything (v4.0)
​From Discrete Information to Continuous Geometry Author: Jacob See
​Abstract
​The Omega Protocol posits that reality is fundamentally a network of informational correlations between minimal observers called Q-regions. Spacetime, gravity, and matter are not fundamental; they are emergent properties of a single scalar field: the Chain Overlap Density (\Phi).
​This repository contains the mathematical formalism, technical documentation, and Python simulations verifying the core axioms of the theory.
​Core Principles
​The theory derives the laws of physics from three informational axioms:
