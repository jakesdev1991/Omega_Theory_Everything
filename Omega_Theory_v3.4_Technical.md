# Emergent Gravity from Information
## The Omega Protocol: Theory of Everything (v3.4)

**Jacob See — November 2025**

### Abstract
Reality is information. Minimal observers (“Q-regions”) exchange quantum correlations; everything else—space, time, gravity—emerges from that network. A single scalar field $\phi$ (Chain Overlap Density) encodes how much information is shared locally.

**New in v3.4:** We define **Mass (Dimension 4)** not as a fundamental object, but as the percentage of Chain Overlap Density that *does not* overlap. Matter is the manifestation of informational asymmetry.

## 1. The Dimensional Hierarchy

1.  **Dimension 1 (Superposition):** The First-Person Perspective. Information exists here in potential.
2.  **Dimension 2 (Reference):** The Relationship. Reality creates a "state" only when a second frame of reference observes the first.
3.  **Dimension 3 (Time as Rate):** Time is a derived rate of change relative to perspective: $t = d(\text{state})/d(\text{perspective})$.
4.  **Dimension 4 (Mass as Non-Overlap):**
    * **Overlap (Singularity):** Perfectly symmetrical information maximizes $\phi$. High gravity, no distinct matter.
    * **Non-Overlap (Matter):** Asymmetrical information decreases $\phi$. The "Difference" manifests as Mass.

## 2. The Core Mathematics

### 2.1 Chain Overlap Density ($\phi$)
For any set $Q$:
$$\phi(Q)= \frac{\sum_k S(\rho_k) - S(\rho_Q)}{|Q|}$$

### 2.2 Distance = Correlation Deficit
Distance is simply the logarithm of information loss:
$$r_{ij} = \ell_P(\phi) \ln\left[\frac{I_{\text{max}}+\varepsilon}{I_{ij}+\varepsilon}\right]$$

### 2.3 Cosmic Acceleration
The universe expands because Black Holes ("Correlation Shredders") sever the quantum connections ($I_{ij}$) that hold space together.
$$d \ln \bar{I}/dt \approx -\gamma_{\text{BH}}(t) A_H(t)$$
